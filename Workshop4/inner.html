                <h2>Dow hits 40,000 for the first time as bull market accelerates</h2>
                <p class="text-muted">By Kate Gibson, May 6, 2024</p>
                <p>Wall Street advanced into uncharted territory on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average topping 40,000 for the first time after a blowout earnings report from Walmart cast a positive light on the U.S. economy.</p>
                <h2>Investors expect "soft landing"</h2>
                <p>Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, noted that stocks have continued climbing as the U.S. seems headed for a so-called soft landing in which inflation recedes to more normal levels and economic growth remains healthy. Consumer spending and job gains, while slowing, also remain robust enough to stave off a prolonged slump even as the Federal Reserve pushes back its timeline for cutting its benchmark interest rate.</p>
                <p>"Think about how many people were talking about recessions and bear markets all last year â€” now we are once again back to new highs," he said. "Investors who were patient and ignored all the scary headlines were once again rewarded, just as they have been throughout history."</p>
                <p>The Dow hit the historic mark as Walmart jumped 7% after delivering robust first-quarter results. After hitting a high of 40,051, the index turned lower to close at 39,869, down 38.6 points, or 0.1%, on the day. The big-box retailer reported a large jump in e-commerce sales, as well as making inroads with high-income shoppers.</p>
